# CONCEPT-Unified-Modular-Assistant
Currently just a concept to be updated overtime. A single centralized personal assistant compute engine, that has modular data inputs, and outputs. The end goal is to build it up in many separate projects then slowly merge them together into one Monolithic compute engine, with each project turned into a module/library used by it.
