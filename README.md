# CONCEPT-Unified-Modular-Assistant
Currently just a concept to be updated overtime. A single centralized personal assistant compute engine, that has modular data inputs, and outputs. The end goal is to build it up in many separate projects then slowly merge them together into one Monolithic compute engine, with each project turned into a module/library used by it.  
  
This repo only exists currently to be a bookmark for this project, and to be slowly updated as the modules come to fruition and then gradualy evolve into a usable piece of software.
